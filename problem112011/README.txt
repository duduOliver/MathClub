This program is used to simulate the changing-triangle of the problem in nov2011-Problem.pdf. 

Before you start to read my codes, hope you would read the problem first. 

Now, I start to consider the case of in-ward direction. Thus I redefine the shortest length as the shortest bisector instead of shortest edge since if not, it might get tenth of shortest edge is longer than some bisectors in a triangle, and then troubles come out. 

WARNING: I start to utilize the triangle project to try some algorithms I am developing in ChangingPolygon project (you can also find in my Github), so you won't get correct results once you use my codes directly even if it complies with no error.
