Input: 2 given angles and the time of iteration
Output: the angles of the triangle

While (the time of iteration > 0 )
{
1.	Initialize a triangle with two given angles.
a.	edge BC of triangle ABC be fixed on x-axis 
b.	let the length of BC = 1
2.	Define the bisector edge	as the distance between a vertex point 
and the midpoint of opposite edge.
3.	initialize the movingLength as the tenth of the shortest bisector edge.
4.	move each vertex inward to the interior of the triangle along the bisector 
in the distance of movingLength
5.	initialize a new triangle with the new angles after moving
